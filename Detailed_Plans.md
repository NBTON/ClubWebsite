# Detailed Plans

## Security Plan

### Authentication & Authorization

**Firebase Auth Implementation**:
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration for seamless login
- JWT token-based authentication with automatic refresh
- Role-based access control (user, organizer, admin)
- Session management with configurable timeouts

**Security Rules**:
- Firestore Security Rules for data access control
- Row-level security based on user roles and ownership
- Validation of user permissions before data operations
- Prevention of unauthorized data access and modification

### Data Protection

**Encryption**:
- Data encrypted at rest and in transit by Firebase
- Sensitive data (emails, personal info) handled securely
- API keys and secrets stored in Firebase Functions config

**Input Validation**:
- Client-side validation for user inputs
- Server-side validation in Cloud Functions
- Sanitization of user-provided data
- Prevention of injection attacks

**Rate Limiting**:
- Firebase Functions rate limiting for API endpoints
- Firestore read/write quotas to prevent abuse
- CAPTCHA integration for suspicious activities
- IP-based rate limiting for critical operations

## Performance Plan

### Database Optimization

**Query Optimization**:
- Efficient Firestore queries with proper indexing
- Pagination for large datasets (events, registrations)
- Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Batch operations for bulk updates

**Indexing Strategy**:
- Composite indexes for complex queries
- Single-field indexes for common filters
- Query planning to minimize document reads
- Regular index performance monitoring

### Frontend Performance

**Code Splitting**:
- Dynamic imports for route-based code splitting
- Lazy loading of components and libraries
- Bundle analysis and optimization
- CDN utilization for static assets

**Caching Strategy**:
- Browser caching for static resources
- Service Worker for offline functionality
- Firebase Cache for Firestore data
- Memory caching for computed data

### Backend Performance

**Function Optimization**:
- Cold start minimization through function warming
- Efficient memory usage in Cloud Functions
- Connection pooling for external API calls
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations

**Data Processing**:
- Batch processing for bulk operations
- Stream processing for real-time data
- Background job queues for heavy computations
- Data aggregation for reporting needs

## Reliability Plan

### Error Handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Fallback UI components for failed operations
- Offline mode capabilities
- Error boundaries in React components
- User-friendly error messages

**Exception Management**:
- Centralized error logging and monitoring
- Structured error responses
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services

### Monitoring & Observability

**Logging Strategy**:
- Structured logging in Cloud Functions
- Firebase Crashlytics for client-side errors
- Performance monitoring with Firebase Performance
- Custom metrics for business operations

**Alerting System**:
- Real-time alerts for critical failures
- Performance degradation notifications
- Usage quota monitoring
- Security incident alerts

### Backup & Recovery

**Data Backup**:
- Firestore automatic daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Export functionality for critical data
- Cross-region replication for disaster recovery

**Business Continuity**:
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) monitoring
- Incident response procedures
- Regular disaster recovery testing
- Fallback procedures for service outages

### Scalability Considerations

**Auto-scaling**:
- Firebase Functions automatic scaling
- Firestore automatic scaling
- Load balancing for high-traffic periods
- Resource allocation based on usage patterns

**Capacity Planning**:
- Performance testing under load
- Resource usage monitoring
- Cost optimization strategies
- Future growth projections
