# Solution Overview

## Firebase-Centric Architecture

The University Club Web Platform is built on a Firebase-centric architecture to leverage its integrated services for authentication, database, serverless functions, and integrations. This approach ensures scalability, security, and ease of development while minimizing infrastructure management.

### Key Components

1. **Frontend (React/Next.js)**
   - User interface for event browsing, registration, and admin dashboard
   - Handles user authentication via Firebase Auth
   - Communicates with Firestore for data retrieval and updates
   - Triggers Cloud Functions for server-side operations

2. **Backend (Firebase Cloud Functions)**
   - Serverless functions for business logic
   - Handles event publishing, registration processing, and notifications
   - Integrates with external services (email, Google Sheets)

3. **Database (Firestore)**
   - NoSQL document database for storing events, registrations, and user data
   - Real-time synchronization capabilities
   - Supports complex queries and data relationships

4. **Authentication (Firebase Auth)**
   - Google login integration for seamless user access
   - Manages user sessions and permissions

5. **Email Notifications**
   - Integration with email service (e.g., SendGrid or Firebase Extensions)
   - Automated notifications for event updates and registrations

6. **Data Export (Google Sheets)**
   - Scheduled or on-demand exports of registration data
   - Uses Google Sheets API for data synchronization

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, Firebase SDK
- **Backend**: Firebase Cloud Functions (Node.js)
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (Google provider)
- **Integrations**: Google Sheets API, Email service API

### Benefits
- **Scalability**: Serverless architecture scales automatically
- **Security**: Built-in Firebase security features and rules
- **Real-time**: Live updates for event data and registrations
- **Cost-effective**: Pay-as-you-go model with Firebase pricing
