# Design Summary

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Firebase-Centric Architecture
**Decision**: Build the entire platform on Firebase ecosystem
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates need for separate backend infrastructure
- Provides built-in authentication, database, and serverless functions
- Reduces development complexity and operational overhead
- Enables real-time features with Firestore
- Cost-effective with pay-as-you-go pricing

**Impact**: Simplifies development while providing enterprise-grade features

### 2. Google OAuth Authentication
**Decision**: Use Google login as the primary authentication method
**Rationale**:
- Seamless user experience with familiar login flow
- Enhanced security through Google's authentication systems
- Automatic user profile data collection
- Reduces password-related security risks
- Aligns with modern authentication best practices

**Impact**: Improves user adoption and security posture

### 3. Firestore Document Structure
**Decision**: Use Firestore with collections for Events, Registrations, and Users
**Rationale**:
- Supports complex queries and real-time updates
- Flexible schema for evolving requirements
- Built-in security rules for data access control
- Automatic scaling and high availability
- Native integration with Firebase Auth

**Impact**: Enables real-time features and simplifies data relationships

### 4. Cloud Functions for Business Logic
**Decision**: Implement server-side logic using Firebase Cloud Functions
**Rationale**:
- Serverless architecture scales automatically
- Secure execution environment
- Direct integration with Firestore and other Firebase services
- Cost-effective for variable workloads
- Supports background processing and integrations

**Impact**: Provides scalable backend processing without infrastructure management

### 5. Single-Click Registration with Optional Reason
**Decision**: Implement one-click registration with optional text field
**Rationale**:
- Reduces friction in the registration process
- Optional reason field provides valuable insights
- Supports both casual and committed registrations
- Aligns with user behavior patterns

**Impact**: Increases registration rates while gathering useful data

### 6. Email and Google Sheets Integration
**Decision**: Use Cloud Functions for email notifications and data exports
**Rationale**:
- Automated notifications improve user engagement
- Google Sheets export enables easy reporting and analysis
- Server-side processing ensures security and reliability
- Supports both real-time and batch operations

**Impact**: Enhances user experience and administrative capabilities

## Security Design Decisions

### 1. Role-Based Access Control
**Decision**: Implement user roles (user, organizer, admin) with Firestore Security Rules
**Rationale**:
- Granular permission control
- Prevents unauthorized data access
- Supports different user types with appropriate privileges
- Enforceable at the database level

**Impact**: Ensures data security and proper access management

### 2. Input Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Client-side and server-side validation with sanitization
**Rationale**:
- Prevents malicious input from reaching the database
- Provides immediate user feedback
- Protects against injection attacks
- Ensures data integrity

**Impact**: Maintains system security and data quality

## Performance Design Decisions

### 1. Pagination and Indexing
**Decision**: Implement pagination for large datasets with optimized Firestore indexes
**Rationale**:
- Handles large numbers of events and registrations efficiently
- Reduces query costs and improves response times
- Supports smooth user experience with large datasets
- Optimizes database performance

**Impact**: Ensures scalability and responsive user interface

### 2. Real-Time Updates
**Decision**: Use Firestore real-time listeners for live data updates
**Rationale**:
- Provides immediate feedback for user actions
- Reduces need for manual refresh
- Enhances user experience with live updates
- Supports collaborative features

**Impact**: Creates modern, responsive user experience

## Reliability Design Decisions

### 1. Error Handling and Monitoring
**Decision**: Comprehensive error handling with monitoring and alerting
**Rationale**:
- Graceful degradation during failures
- Proactive issue identification
- User-friendly error messages
- System health monitoring

**Impact**: Improves system stability and user trust

### 2. Backup and Recovery
**Decision**: Implement automated backups with point-in-time recovery
**Rationale**:
- Protects against data loss
- Enables quick recovery from failures
- Supports business continuity requirements
- Meets data retention needs

**Impact**: Ensures data durability and business continuity
